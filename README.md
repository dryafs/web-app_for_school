Here will be a project that incorporates my modern vision of a public school web application. In this project, I plan to use React+Redux. This project is not perfect - as it is my first project after my studies. It will use a fake API


The technologies I want to use in this project:
- React + Redux
- Various libraries
- Java(but I'm not sure about this as I'm just starting to write the project)

With this project, I would like to summarise all the knowledge I have gained from the React + Redux course.


To run the project, you need to upload the full file.
Next, in the terminal, enter 
npm i
In order for all dependencies to be pulled in locally
Next. 
npm start
Now you can test my project, if you want to log in as a user, you can use values like:
login: admin
password: admin

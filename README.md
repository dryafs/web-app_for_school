Here will be a project that incorporates my modern vision of a public school web application. In this project, I plan to use React+Redux. This project is not perfect - as it is my first project after my studies. It will use a fake API


The technologies I want to use in this project:
- React + Redux
- Various libraries
- Java(but I'm not sure about this as I'm just starting to write the project)

With this project, I would like to summarise all the knowledge I have gained from the React + Redux course.
